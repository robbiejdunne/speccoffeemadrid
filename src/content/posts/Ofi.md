## Overview

This is one of our favourite coffee shops in Madrid. It's outside of the centre but it's literally got everything we look for in our coffee shops. The staff are friendly (shout-out to Sofia the owner), it's spacious with really laid-back design, has good wifi so you can get some work done and, most importantly, they serve excellent coffee. 

## Coffee

They have a variety of coffees and when we visited they had some from Puchero, the incresingly popular roasters close to Valladolid, and also from The Fix in Madrid.
